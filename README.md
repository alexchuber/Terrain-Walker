# Terrain-Walker
Made Fall 2021

I made this as part of my digital arts & sciences class. The so-called "terrain walker" randomly generates terrain in the same way that a random walk algoritm works. \
First, the terrain is represented by either squares or hexagons. Each "step", or shape, that the walker takes must be directly adjacent to the last "step".
The direction of the next step-- or which side of the square/hexagon it will be adjacent to-- is decided randomly. \
Multiple steps over the same spot result in different terrain colors. For example, a white shape indicates a high number of steps taken there.

This project was made with Processing, a free graphical library and IDE that uses Java. Be sure to rename the root folder to Project5 if you'd like to run it for yourself.
